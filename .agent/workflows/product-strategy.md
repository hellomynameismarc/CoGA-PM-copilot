description: Create Product Strategy - Interactive Rumelt's Kernel interview with Devil's Advocate challenges
---

1. **Context Setup**
   - Read `.agent/rules/copilot-rules.md`.
   - Read `jobs-to-be-done/02-product-strategy/script.md`.
   - Read `jobs-to-be-done/02-product-strategy/templates/strategy-template.md`.

2. **Thinking Mode & Interview**
   - **Research Phase**: Before the interview, browse validity of competitors if mentioned in `tasks/` or execute a web search if specific competitors are named.
   - Generate a draft `product-work/strategy/competitive-landscape.md` if context allows.
   - Follow `jobs-to-be-done/02-product-strategy/script.md` precisely.
   - For each strategic choice, play the **Devil's Advocate** as instructed in the script.
   - Do NOT skip the challenge phase.

3. **Draft Strategy Doc**
   - Synthesize the user's choices into the Rumelt Strategy Kernel framework.
   - Use the structure from `jobs-to-be-done/02-product-strategy/templates/strategy-template.md`.
   - **Important**: Save to `product-work/strategy/YYYY-MM-DD-strategy-focus.md`.

4. **Review**
   - Ask if the user wants an Executive Review (`/review-exec`) or to generate slides (`/product-strategy` again with a slide prompt logic, or just manual instructions).
