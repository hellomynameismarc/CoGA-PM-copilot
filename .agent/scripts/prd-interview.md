**STOP**: Wait for user response.

**Step 3: Solution Validation**
"Why is this the *right* solution? What alternatives did you consider and reject?"
**STOP**: Wait for user response.

**Step 4: Success Criteria**
"How will we measure success? What is the specific metric we are trying to move, and by how much?"
**STOP**: Wait for user response.

**Step 5: Strategic Fit**

**STOP**: Wait for user response.
