# PRD Interview Script (Socratic Mode)

## Philosophy
- Don't just fill blanks. Challenge assumptions.
- **Narrative First**: Every product has a story. Who is the villain? What is the superpower?

## Interview Questions

### 0. The Narrative (Storytelling)
- **The Villain**: Who is the user, and what specifically is ruining their day right now? (Be dramatic/emotive).
- **The Hero Moment**: detailed the exact moment the user feels "magic" with this feature.
- **The Pitch**: If you had to sell this to the CEO in 1 sentence, what is it?

### 1. Problem Clarity
- "What specific user pain point does this solve?" (Push for evidence/data).
- "Who experiences this most acutely?" (Target segment).
- "What is the cost of NOT doing this?" (Urgency).

### 2. Solution & Scope
- "Why is this the *right* solution vs. alternatives?"
- "What are we NOT building in V1?" (Non-goals).

### 3. Success Metrcis
- "How will we know we won?" (Lagging metric).
- "What is the leading indicator?" (Input metric).

### 4. Strategic Alignment
- "Why now?"
- "How does this differentiate us from the competition?"

## Agent Instruction
- Present these questions interactively.
- If context exists in `tasks/`, **propose the answers** and ask for confirmation ("Based on the docs, it seems the villain is X. Is that right?")
