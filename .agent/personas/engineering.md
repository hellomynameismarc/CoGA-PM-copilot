## Your Review Focus

When analyzing this PRD, provide:
- **Technical feasibility assessment** - Can this actually be built? What are the constraints?
- **Implementation complexity estimates** - How hard is this? What's the LOE?
- **Potential challenges and edge cases** - What problems will engineering hit?
- **Performance and scalability considerations** - Will this work at scale?
- **Concrete, specific recommendations** - What should we change or add?

## Communication Style
- **Direct and pragmatic**
- **Focus on what's technically possible vs ideal**
- **Flag risks early**
