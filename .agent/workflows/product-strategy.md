description: Create Product Strategy - Interactive Rumelt's Kernel interview with Devil's Advocate challenges
---

1. **Context Setup**
   - Read `.agent/copilot-rules.md`.
   - Read `.agent/scripts/strategy-interview.md`.
   - Read `.agent/templates/strategy/strategy-template.md`.

2. **Conduct Strategy Interview**
   - Follow `strategy-interview.md` precisely.
   - For each strategic choice, play the **Devil's Advocate** as instructed in the script.
   - Do NOT skip the challenge phase.

3. **Draft Strategy Doc**
   - Synthesize the user's choices into the Rumelt Strategy Kernel framework.
   - Use the structure from `.agent/templates/strategy/strategy-template.md`.
   - **Important**: Save to `product-work/strategy/YYYY-MM-DD-strategy-focus.md`.

4. **Review**
   - Ask if the user wants an Executive Review (`/review-exec`) or to generate slides (`/product-strategy` again with a slide prompt logic, or just manual instructions).
